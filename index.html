                            Hi, I’m Payal Maheshwari. 
                            I am studying Computer Science & Engineering at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore.
                            I’m currently learning Front-end web development and 
                            I'm a college student seeking an Internship in Software Engineering to strengthen my coding and designing abilities. 
                            The ability to pay close attention to detail, communicate with others, and be eager to learn are some of my few strengths.
                            I’m interested in Full stack web development.

                                The goal of this project was to build a neural network able to classify which number of the Indian Sign Language (ISL) dataset is being signed, given an image of a signing hand. This project is a first step towards building a possible Indian sign language translator, which can take communication in sign language and translate them into written language.
